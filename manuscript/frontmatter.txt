# Foreword #

Thank you for your interest in this book. I hope you'll have a good time reading it and learn something from it.

# About this book

This book is intended for the intermediate Scala programmer who is interested in functional programming and works mainly on the web service backend side. Ideally she has experience with libraries like Akka HTTP[^1] and Slick[^2] which are in heavy use in that area.

However maybe you have wondered if we can't do better even though aforementioned projects are battle tested and proven.

The answer to this can be found in this book which is intended to be read from cover to cover in the given order. Within the book the following libraries will be used: Cats[^3], Cats Effect[^4], http4s[^5], Doobie[^6], Refined[^7], fs2[^8] and probably others. ;-)

# Thanks

I would like to thank my beloved wife and family who bear with me and make all of this possible.
Also I send a big thank you to alle the nice people from the Scala community which I've had the pleasure to meet.
