# Our use case #

For better understanding we will implement a small use case in both impure and pure way. The following section will outline the specification.

# Service specification

First we need to specify the exact scope and API of our service. We'll design a service with a minimal API to keep things simple. It shall fulfil the following requirements.

The service shall provide HTTP API endpoints for:

1. the creation of a product data type identified by a unique id
2. adding translations for a product name by language code and unique id
3. returning the existing translations for a product
4. returning a list of all existing products with their translations

## Data model

We will keep the model very simple to avoid going overboard with the implementation.

1. A language code shall be defined by the ISO 639-1 (e.g. a two letter code).
2. A translation shall contain a language code and a product name (non-empty string).
3. A product shall contain a unique id (UUID version 4) and a list of translations.

## Database

The data will be stored in a relational database (RDBMS). Therefore we need to define the tables and relations within the database.

### The products table

The table `products` must contain only the unique id which is also the primary key.

### The names table

The table `names` must contain a column for the product id, one for the language code and one for the name. Its primary key is the combination of the product id and the language code. All columns must not be null. The relation to the products is realised by a foreign key constraint to the `products` table via the product id.

## HTTP API

The HTTP API shall provide the following endpoints on the given paths:

| Path              | HTTP method | Function                              |
|-------------------|-------------|---------------------------------------|
| `/products`       | POST        | Create a product.                     |
| `/products`       | GET         | Get all products and translations.    |
| `/product/{UUID}` | PUT         | Add translations.                     |
| `/product/{UUID}` | GET         | Get all translations for the product. |

The data shall be encoded in JSON using the following specification:

{caption: "JSON for a translation"}
```json
{
  "lang": "ISO-639-1 Code",
  "name": "A non empty string."
}
```

{caption: "JSON for a product"}
```json
{
  "id": "The-UUID-of-the-product",
  "names": [
    // A list of translations.
  ]
}
```

This should be enough to get us started.

# The state of the art #

Within the Scala ecosystem the Akka-HTTP library is a popular choice for implementing server side backends for HTTP APIs. Another quite popular option is the Play framework but using a full blown web framework to just provide a thin API is overkill in most cases. As most services need a database the Slick library is another popular choice which completes the picture.

However while all mentioned libraries are battle tested and proven they still have problems.

# Problems

In the domain of functional programming we want referential transparency which we will define in the following way:

I> An expression `e` is referential transparent if we can in any given program replace any occurances of `e` with the result of the evaluation of `e` without changing the behaviour of the program.

Building on that we need pure functions which are

1. only dependent on their input
2. have no side effects

This means in turn that our functions will be referential transparent.

**But**, the mentioned libraries are built upon the `Future` from Scala which uses eager evaluation and breaks referential transparency. Let's look at an example.

{caption: "Future example 1"}
```scala
import scala.concurrent.Future
import scala.concurrent.ExecutionContext.Implicits.global

for {
  _ <- Future { println("Hi there!") }
  _ <- Future { println("Hi there!") }
} yield ()
```

The code above will print the text `Hi there!` two times. But how about the following one?

{caption: "Future example 2"}
```scala
import scala.concurrent.Future
import scala.concurrent.ExecutionContext.Implicits.global

val printF = Future { println("Hi there!") }

for {
  _ <- printF
  _ <- printF
} yield ()
```

Instead of printing the text two times it will print it only once even when there is no usage of `printF` at all (try omitting the for comprehension). This means that `Future` breaks referential transparency!

Q> So `Future` makes it harder (sometimes impossible) to reason about our code and also raises the bar for testability. What can we do?

# Maybe there is another way #

If we want referential transparency, we must push the side effects to the boundaries of our system (program) which can be done by using lazy evaluation. Let's repeat the previous example in a different way.

{caption: "IO example 1"}
```scala
import cats.effect.IO
import cats.implicits._

val effect = for {
  _ <- IO(println("Hi there!"))
  _ <- IO(println("Hi there!"))
} yield ()
```

The above code will produce no output. Only if we evaluate the variable `effect` which is of type `IO[Unit]` will the output be generated (try `effect.unsafeRunSync` in the REPL). Also the second approach works like expected.

{caption: "IO example 2"}
```scala
import cats.effect.IO
import cats.implicits._

val printF = IO(println("Hi there!"))

val effect = for {
  _ <- printF
  _ <- printF
} yield ()
```

Q> What have we gained?

Suddenly we can much more easily reason about our code! And why is that? Well we don't have unexpected side effects caused by code running even when it doesn't need to. This is a sneak peak how pure code looks like. Now we only need to implement pure libraries for our use, or do we?

Luckily for us meanwhile there are several pure options available in the Scala ecosystem. We will stick to the cats family of libraries namely http4s and Doobie as replacements for Akka-HTTP and Slick. They build upon the Cats Effect library which is an implementation of an IO monad for Scala. Some other options exist but we'll stick to the one from Cats.

To be able to contrast both ways of implementing a service we will first implement it using Akka-HTTP and Slick and will then migrate to http4s and Doobie.

# Impure implementation

We'll be using the following libraries for the impure version of the service:

1. Akka (including Akka-HTTP and Akka-Streams)
2. Slick (as database layer)
3. Flyway for database migrations (or evolutions)
4. Circe for JSON codecs and akka-http-json as wrapper
5. Refined for using refined types
6. the PostgreSQL JDBC driver

I'll spare you the sbt setup as you can look that up in the code repository (e.g. the `impure` folder in the book repo).

## Models

First we'll implement our models which are simple and straightforward. At first we need a class to store our translations or better a single translation.

```scala
final case class Translation(lang: String, name: String)
```

Q> So what is wrong with that approach?

Technically it is okay but we have a bad feeling about it. Using `Option[String]` is of no use because both fields have to be set. But a `String` can always be `null` and contain a lot of unexpected stuff (literally anything).

I> This is the moment when refined types come to you rescue!

So let us define some refined types which we can use later on. At first we need a language code which obeys the restrictions of ISO-639-1 and we need a stronger definition for a product name. For the former we use a regular expression and for the latter we simply expect a string which is not empty.

{caption: "Refined types for models"}
```scala
type LanguageCode = String Refined MatchesRegex[W.`"^[a-z]{2}$"`.T]
type ProductName = String Refined NonEmpty
```

Now we can give our translation model another try.

{caption: "Translation model using refined types"}
```scala
final case class Translation(lang: LanguageCode, name: ProductName)
```

Much better and while we're at it we can also write the JSON codecs using the refined module of the Circe library. We put them into the companion object of the model.

```scala
object Translation {
  implicit val decode: Decoder[Translation] =
    Decoder.forProduct2("lang", "name")(Translation.apply)

  implicit val encode: Encoder[Translation] =
    Encoder.forProduct2("lang", "name")(t => (t.lang, t.name))
}
```

Now onwards to the product model. Because we already now of refined types we can use them from start here.

```scala
type ProductId = String Refined Uuid
final case class Product(id: ProductId, names: List[Translation])
```

Q> Now what is wrong about this?

If we look closely we realise that a `List` maybe empty. Which is valid for the list but not for our product because we need at least one entry. Luckily for us the cats library has us covered with the `NonEmptyList` data type. Including the JSON codecs this leads us to our final implementation.

{caption: "Product model using refined types and NeL"}
```scala
final case class Product(id: ProductId, names: NonEmptyList[Translation])

object Product {
  implicit val decode: Decoder[Product] =
    Decoder.forProduct2("id", "names")(Product.apply)

  implicit val encode: Encoder[Product] =
    Encoder.forProduct2("id", "names")(p => (p.id, p.names))
}
```

Now we have the models covered and can move on to the database layer.
